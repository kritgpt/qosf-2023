# QOSF 2023 Submission

This is my submission for the Cohort 7 of QOSF's mentorship program screening tasks. 

I chose to tackle `Task 1` and questions relating to it, since one of my main interests is in the field of quantum algorithms. This was an amazing chance to read up
various resources on how circuits such as the one can be implemented, choose an appropriate circuit and understand how this problem relates to Shor's algorithm.

## Files

- `README.md`: This file, explaining the more abstract side of the task: my motivations, findings and new understandings developed relating to the problem due to this task.
- `comparator.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing and explaining the code for the comparator circuit.
- `comparator.py`: A Python file containing the code for the comparator circuit.
